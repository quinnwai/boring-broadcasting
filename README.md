## Login Details: 

## Creative Portion: 
Created a seperate SQL table called upvotes. Stories can be upvoted and sorted by the number of upvotes they have on the feed. Ensures only registered users can upvote and only one upvote is allowed per user.

Added user_details page which stores and displays only the stories the user has posted. The user is able to view/edit/delete his stories from his profile page as well as the news feed directly. The user is shown details about his profile such as registered name and username and is able to logout directly from this page as well. 

Added option to be able to change password which updates the sql table accordingly and stores the new password.

Added functionality for being able to navigate to feed and logout from various pages for ease of use
